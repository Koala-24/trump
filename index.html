                <p1 class="int">In the days after the first US travel ban was announced in January, Anita Carlyle CMP, CMM, managing partner at Moore Carlyle Consulting and MCC Destination Management, reports that three of their programs changed as a direct result of the US action. One of them, an Italian incentive group that had planned to visit Chicago and New York, changed their destinations to Toronto and Montreal. “They didn’t want a possible hassle at the US border.” She also says that some US groups are hesitant to travel abroad because of green card issues and negative sentiment toward the US abroad.

                At press time, a revised travel ban—which was to go into effect March 16 and prevents foreign nationals from Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen who don’t have a valid visa from entering the United States for 90 days—was held up in the courts, but it’s clear this is an issue we will have to grapple with for some time. Here’s a look at the current impact and how industry organizations are reacting.</p1>

The specific exemption for legal permanent

Any increased restrictions on passenger
travel must be based in safety and security
to ensure that the ability to travel is
not impeded unnecessarily. It will remalein
a focus of the business travel industry to

will continue to monitor the implementation

        <span class="end-q-black">“</span> The swift and coordinated response to President Trump's
travel ban by Meetings Mean Business (MMB) in the US is proof
of the importance of the business events industry speaking
with one voice and articulating one message: <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">that face-to-face
meetings create employment, generate incredible economic
impact and contribute to the productive transfer of knowledge
and expertise. Anything that impedes the free flow of delegates
attending meetings, conferences, trade shows and other events
          has a direct effect on the economy.
        <br><br>
As we embark on the next phase of building Meetings Mean
Business in Canada, we see the current political climate in the
US as a perfect example of why we need key industry decision-
makers and influencers here to support our Coalition: to
ensure that when the next recession or SARS epidemic or terrorist
attack or other unforeseen situation occurs, our advocacy
platform is ready to activate and can build on the strong message
that in-person meetings and events are big business and
          are critical to a successful economy. <span class="end-q-black">”</span> </span>

       <h4>A NEW WRINKLE</h4> On March 21, US-bound travellers from 10 airports in Turkey, the Middle
East and North Africa were banned from carrying large electronic
devices on board, including tablets, laptops and Kindles. The Department
of Homeland Security cited fears that bombs can be concealed in such
devices. The ACTE responded on the same day: “Does the Department of
Homeland Security know about a threat so great that it can’t be shared
with the business travel industry? Or are these latest restrictions about to
resonate as the new norm the world over? Speculation rivals uncertainty
for bad news in the travel industry. Answers are needed now,” said executive
director Greeley Koch, adding: “The first rule in business travel is not
to be separated from anything essential to the success of your trip. And
the most important component is your laptop or tablet. Travellers who do
not check baggage normally, will now have to check their laptops, tablets
and e-readers on the affected flights. Baggage goes missing every day.
Can you imagine the consequences of losing a week’s, or a month’s work,
plus your confidential corporate data to a luggage theft?”
